# Chess Anonymous
A very basic chess engine built with Python &amp; Pygame for two-player play.

I built this engine due to IT filters at work blocking chess websites. 

*At the moment, we still have access to IDEs and Python scripts*

# Installation

```python
import pygame
```

# General
* Sounds sourced from Chess.com.

* Basic chess rules are in place: en-passant, castling, pawn promotion (queen only at this point).

* Press 'Z' to undo a move (Lichess takeback).

* Press 'R' to restart the game.
